# Standards

All `yaml` files in this directory are assumed to conform to https://github.com/opencontrol/schemas/tree/master/kwalify/standard

## Available Standards

- **TSC-2017.yml**: Original 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy
- **TSC-2022.yml**: 2017 Trust Services Criteria with Revised Points of Focus (2022) - *Recommended for new implementations*

The TSC-2022 file includes the same core criteria as TSC-2017 but incorporates the AICPA's 2022 revised points of focus that address modern cybersecurity threats, enhanced governance guidance, and updated risk assessment approaches.

Adjust the target standard for this project by adding or removing line-items within each file, or adding/removing a standard file entirely.
